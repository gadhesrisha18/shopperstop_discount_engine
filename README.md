# ShopperStop Promotional Pricing Engine (PPE)

A configurable, API-driven discount engine that replaces ShopperStop's hardcoded
promotional pricing logic. Marketing and operations teams can create, activate, and
combine promotions through REST APIs — no code deployments required.

Built with **Python 3.12 + FastAPI**, an **in-memory SQLite** database (zero setup for
reviewers), and a **Strategy-pattern discount engine** designed to make adding new
discount types a pure addition, never a modification.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker build -t ppe .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ppe
```

### Option 2 — Local

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # optional but recommended
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- **Health check**: http://localhost:8000/health

The database is in-memory SQLite and is seeded automatically on startup with:
- Two customer tiers (`REGULAR`, `PREMIUM`) matching the slabs in the spec
- Five demo promotions (flat, category, time-based, buy-x-get-y, and an inactive
  percentage coupon) showing every discount type and the stacking rules in action

No external database, message queue, or paid service is required.

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

57 tests, 93% coverage on `app/` (well above the 80% target on the core engine).
See **TESTING.md** for a full breakdown and how to run specific suites.

### Request flow (bill calculation)

1. `POST /api/v1/bills/calculate` hits `routes/bill.py`, which validates the payload
   against `BillCalculateRequest`.
2. `bill_service.calculate_bill()` loads the customer's tier slab config and every
   **active** promotion applicable to the request's store/tier/time from the repository.
3. Each promotion is turned into a `DiscountStrategy` instance via `discounts/factory.py`.
4. Strategies are sorted by `priority` (ascending — lower runs first) and applied
   **sequentially against a running total**, so later discounts see the effect of
   earlier ones. Each strategy reports whether it applied and why (or why not).
5. The configured stacking rule (`max_total_discount_rate` in `discount_rules.json`)
   is enforced as a hard cap — if the cumulative discount would exceed it, the last
   discount is trimmed and the response is marked `capped: true`.
6. A full breakdown (each discount evaluated, applied or skipped, and why) is returned
   — this is what a cashier or the finance team would need for reconciliation.

`preview: true` in the request (or the dedicated `/promotions/simulate` endpoint) runs
the exact same pipeline without persisting anything — calculation is a pure function of
its inputs, so it's naturally idempotent.

## Key Design Decisions

See **DESIGN.md** for the full write-up. In brief:

- **Strategy pattern** for discount types — new types are additive (new class +
  factory entry), never touch existing code (Open/Closed principle).
- **Configuration-driven**, not hardcoded — tier slabs and global stacking rules live
  in `config/discount_rules.json`; per-promotion parameters live in the database and
  are editable via the Promotion API without a deploy.
- **In-memory SQLite via SQLAlchemy** — real ORM/relational semantics and zero external
  setup for reviewers; swapping to Postgres is a one-line connection string change.
- **Sequential stacking against a running total** with a configurable priority order
  and a hard percentage cap, so "max 40% off" is enforced regardless of which
  promotions happen to be active.
- **`Decimal` everywhere in money math** — no floating-point rounding surprises in a
  billing system.

## Limitations / Future Enhancements

The project implements all core requirements of the assignment, including the discount engine,
REST APIs, configuration-driven promotions, request validation, health checks, audit trail,
and automated tests.

The following enhancements are not currently implemented and would be suitable for a
production-scale deployment:

- Caching– Active promotions could be cached (e.g., Redis) to reduce repeated database lookups.
- Rate Limiting – Protect APIs from excessive requests using middleware or an API gateway.
- Feature Flags – Allow gradual rollout of new promotions and discount strategies.
- Event-Driven Architecture– Publish promotion lifecycle events for analytics, notifications, or downstream systems.
- External Database – The project uses an embedded/in-memory database for simplicity and easy local setup, as required by the assignment.
